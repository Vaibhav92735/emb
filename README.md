## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project demonstrates a full pipeline for processing video frames on resource-constrained platforms:

1. **Extract** individual frames from a video file in Python.
2. **Convert** grayscale frames into C-style 2D arrays for embedding in firmware.
3. **Compress** the embedded frames on a microcontroller via delta or run-length encoding (RLE), storing compressed data in flash memory (EEPROM).
4. **Capture** the raw compressed output over serial back to a host PC for analysis or storage.

The focus is on optimizing memory footprint and CPU load so that these techniques can run on low-power microcontrollers commonly used in mobile and edge devices.

## âœ… Features
- **Frame extraction** via OpenCV script with command-line options.
- **Image-to-C array** header generation using Pillow.
- **Delta and RLE compression** routines in Arduino C++ (with selection at runtime).
- **EEPROM storage** of compressed data for non-volatile retention.
- **Raw serial capture** utility in Python for host-side logging.

## âš™ Components & Workflow

1. **`extract_frames.py`** (Python):  
   - Reads a video file and saves every _n_<sup>th</sup> frame as an image.

2. **`image_to_c_array.py`** (Python):  
   - Converts a single grayscale image into a `.h` file defining a 2D `uint8_t` array.

3. **`compressor.ino`** (Arduino C++):  
   - Embeds `frame_array.h` via `PROGMEM`.  
   - Offers two modes:  
     - **Delta compression**: differences between successive pixels.  
     - **RLE compression**: runs of identical pixel values.  
   - Stores output in EEPROM at separate address regions.  
   - User selects mode (`d` or `r`) over serial at startup.

4. **`serial_raw_dumper.py`** (Python):  
   - Connects to the microcontrollerâ€™s serial port.  
   - Reads raw bytes in fixed-size chunks and writes them to a binary file.
